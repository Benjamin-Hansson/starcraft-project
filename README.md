# StarCraft II bot

## Setup for creating your own bot

Start of by forking this repository by pressing the fork button above, this
will create your own copy of this repository.

This will bring you to your own version of this page.

Next you want to clone the new repository using the following command: `git
clone <path>`, where `<path>` is the url to the right of the fork button you
just pressed. If you have configured ssh-access use the ssh link, otherwise use
the http link.

Next, you need to setup the library. See [PyCommandCenter's page on PyCharm]
for how to do that.

Now everything is ready for PyCharm, start PyCharm and select "Open" and
navigate to the location you clone your fork of this repository.

In order to run the code, right file name "main.py" in the project panel on the
right and select "Debug main". This will run the code in "main.py" and start
StarCraft II. You can also edit the code in "main.py" by double-clicking on it.
